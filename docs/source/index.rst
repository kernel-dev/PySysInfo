PySysInfo gathers CPU, memory, storage, and graphics details across Linux, macOS, and Windows into a single set of Pydantic models. The top-level `HardwareManager` picks the right platform manager at import time, so usage stays the same everywhere.

Highlights
----------
- Cross-platform: sysfs on Linux, Registry/WMI on Windows, sysctl and IORegistry on macOS.
- Unified data model: `HardwareInfo` bundles component models for easy serialization.
- Pluggable managers: `LinuxHardwareManager`, `MacHardwareManager`, and `WindowsHardwareManager` expose the same API.
